# Gob: An Experimental Cross-Platform Pure(ish) Go Web Browser and Rendering Engine

Gob is an experimental pure Go web browser mostly built on around x/exp/shiny
and the standard image package. It's currently very much a work-in-progress
and probably isn't much use to you (unless maybe you're running on Plan 9 and 
have very low standards for web browsers..)

If you'd like to contribute, you can read CONTRIBUTING.md and DESIGN.md
for ideas on where to get started. If you'd just like to try it.. you probably
don't, at least not until it matures a little more. You can't do anything other
than render pages which don't do anything more complex than CSS1 or click on
links (yet.)
